# AI-Powered Working Instruction Generation for Industrial Manufacturing
Turning Videos into Work Instructions -- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

---

Some of my colleagues shared how writing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) from scratch was taking way too long. They had to pause videos, take screenshots, write step-by-step instructions, and even translate documents for different teams. It was slow, repetitive, and easy to make mistakes.
So we asked—why not let AI handle most of this work?
I created an automated workflow using the Gemini AI platform. Here’s how it works:
•	Gemini analyzes factory videos, understands the key steps, and helps create clear instructions.
•	I designed smart prompts so the AI knows exactly what to look for in each video, making the guide very accurate.
•	I used another tool, OpenCV, to automatically grab the needed images from the video.
•	Finally, a Python script pulls all this together into a ready-to-use, multi-language document template.
The results were great—we cut down the time needed to create work instructions, and teams across different languages could use the same templates. This made the process faster, more consistent, and freed up our team to focus on higher-value work.

## 1. Background and Objectives

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are essential documents in industrial manufacturing that ensure process consistency, quality, and safety. Traditionally, creating SOPs has been a labor-intensive process involving manual video review, screenshot capture, step-by-step documentation, and translation into multiple languages. This manual process is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error.

The objective of this internship was to leverage artificial intelligence to automate the generation of work instructions from manufacturing videos. The goal was to drastically reduce the time and effort required, improve consistency and accuracy, and support multi-language output to meet the needs of diverse teams across global factories.

## 2. Technical Approach & Methodology

The project adopted the following technical workflow:

1. **Video Analysis with AI:** Utilized the Gemini AI platform to analyze production videos, identify key process steps, and generate clear step-by-step descriptions.
2. **Prompt Engineering:** Developed specialized prompts to guide the AI in extracting domain-specific actions and details, enhancing accuracy and relevance.
3. **Automated Image Extraction:** Employed OpenCV to automatically capture relevant frames from videos, matching visual content with each documented step.
4. **Document Assembly:** Created Python scripts to compile AI-generated instructions and extracted images into standardized document templates.
5. **Multi-language Support:** Utilized the Gemini API to instantly convert instructions into multiple languages, facilitating deployment across different regions.

This methodology combined computer vision, natural language processing, and automation to create an end-to-end solution for work instruction generation.
