Implemented an automated, real-time defect detection system using computer vision techniques to identify and classify surface defects on components.

**7. Parts Surface Defect Detection**  
Previously, quality checks on part surfaces were all done manually—inefficient and sometimes inaccurate.  
My challenge was to build a real-time, low-cost defect detection system.  
I used Raspberry Pi hardware and computer vision, fine-tuned existing detection models on real samples, and automated the workflow.  
This significantly sped up quality checks and reduced human errors.

Next is about computer vision

Human inspectors are easy to getting tired and inconsistent
So we need a smart inspection system to help this.

In this project I Trained a YOLO model for defect detection
YOLO learns five features of parts that enable it to recognize and classify parts based on defect type.

For now
don’t have enough samples to improve accuracy
Once we have enough samples, it will be very helpful
