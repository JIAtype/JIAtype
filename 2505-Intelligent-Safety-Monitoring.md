Customized a YOLO-based model to create a worker safety detection system capable of real-time human behavior analysis and early warning of safety incidents.

**8. AI Detection System for Workplace Safety**  
In large-scale factories, it’s very tough to detect accidents like employee falls in real time, and manual monitoring just isn’t fast enough.  
I set out to build an AI system to spot accidents and sound alerts.  
I customized a YOLOv8 model to analyze camera footage on the fly—automatically detecting falls and unusual behaviors.  
With this, the alert accuracy reached 92%, and the team was able to react much faster.

Everyone knows safety first
Workers falling or not wearing helmets was a real concern
So we can Build a smart safety Monitoring to Handel this kind situation

I still Used YOLO models for object detection.
In this case YOLO will Recognize human body and helmet

If any safety risks are found, they will be displayed on this website
Enable managers to timely identify and take action
