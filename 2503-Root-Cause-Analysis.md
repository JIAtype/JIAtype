Developed an AI-driven approach for production abnormality cause analysis, employing data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to identify the root causes of non-conformance in manufacturing processes.

**6. Root Cause Analysis for Non-Conforming Parts**  
Defective parts were appearing too frequently, and the causes werenâ€™t clear, making the manufacturing process hard to improve.  
I used ensemble machine learning models to analyze historical data, not just predicting defect cases but also identifying the most critical factors.  
Luckily, I was able to pinpoint the top five causes and suggest concrete ways to optimize production.

First Project

We are experiencing a part quality issue that is difficult to pinpoint.
So we use machine learning to find the root causes

I cleaned and sorted the collected data, performed EDA, and gave some visual charts to show the data characteristics. Then I used decision trees and random forests to analyze parameters to find the 5 most important features. 

After these I gave conclusions and reports.
