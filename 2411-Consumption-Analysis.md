Shopping Mall Consumer Analytics and Prediction

The aim of my project was to analyze shopping mall sales data and develop practical strategies for increasing overall revenue.  
To do this, I built a smart analytics platform capable of identifying high-value customers, segmenting the user base, and predicting consumer behavior.

00:40 - the Dynamic Window Algorithm (DWA) effectively processes time series data, allowing us to track how new member sign-ups correlate with overall revenue trends.
01:00 - detects and highlights revenue peaks for the mall, making it easy to identify periods of strong performance.
01:06 - Analyze and visualize data to quickly spot anomalies and special cases within the sales data.
01:16 - Clustering algorithms K-Means are used to stratify and segment user RFM(Recency-Frequency-Monetary) data, gives us deep insights into diverse consumer behaviors and helps tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
01:27 - Use decision tree classification algorithm to accurately identify high-value customers.

00:11 – After all these resentation of overall consumer characteristics.
01:10,01:30 - Combine data mining and machine learning technology to provide personalized product recommendations to high-value customers and improve conversion and repurchase rates.
01:58 - Based on customer consumption sequences and inventory data, the genetic algorithm (GA) is integrated to intelligently output the optimal purchase/replenishment suggestions for merchants, reduce inventory risks and improve capital flow efficiency.
